Vida in Spanish means "life". Zing means "energy, enthusiasm, or liveliness". VidaZing is about working towards a meaningful and exciting life.

VidaZing rises from the ashes of misspent youth. The journey is straightforward yet time consuming:

1) Waste hours, days, and years on fun but innately distracting activities.

2) Read self help books, articles, and news.

3) Meet impressive individuals.

4) Make changes using the new ideas.

5) Distill those lessons to family and close friends.

6) Aim to do more.

# Let's break this down.

Let's imagine going through this together. Think of it as a choose your own adventure with 1 path.

1) I'm young, lack guidance, and have lots of time. Hedonism anyone?

2) I'm still not happy. Something is fundamentally wrong but I don't know what. To solve this I need to ask the right questions. Since I lack guidance, I'll have to find some. So I read.

3) Reading helps. Yet it is not the only way. Time to break out of my shell. I meet new people. They excel in areas I do not. While struggling to find my focus, I'll experience life through their eyes.

4) My subconscious is hard at work. Unbeknownst to me, I internalize these traits, merging with tens of thousands of words from reading for 4 hours a day. I start changing. I feel happier. Achievement unlocked! More options appear in life. 

5) Time to reflect on this journey. Something becomes apparent; My life gets better, others still struggle. I want to make a difference. Many efforts fail. Some work. Everyone wins.

6) More reflection. The world is a better place. Can I help those wanting more from life? Where will they go? How do I reach them? VidaZing.

# Reflect on your journey

It's important to not regret the past. Don't play the what if game. You cannot win. More importantly you are not you in the what if game, but a highly edited clone. I would much rather view failures as the price of admission for life's best events.

The past exists for reflection. It guides your steps towards a better life. Socrates said "The unexamined life is not worth living." But this isn't about intellectual sounding, yet empty platitudes. VidaZing is about helping you change your life.
