# Define your VidaZing
What we want is to be happier. What is happiness? That changes from one being to another. Your dog will be pretty happy being with you; a lion will be pretty happy you in it. What makes you happy?

You can achieve VidaZing once you examine your behavior, strip away the unnecessary, and focus your effort on lasting change. Bask in the glory of your future self's happiness.

Anyone who seeks out VidaZing is probably on a similar journey and wants more out of life. Maybe you don't know why you came here, maybe you don't know what your problems are, maybe you don't know how to solve them. All of these phases of life can benefit from examining your life, taking the steps to correct course, and grow your enthusiasm for life.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
